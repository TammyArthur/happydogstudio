          <h1 class="section-title">A studio inspired by CF and a dog.</h1>
          <p>Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Tammy Arthur and I'm YOUR Freelance Graphic Designer!</p>
          <p><em>About the studio:</em> The studio was born in 2009 out of a need be available at home for my daughter's cystic fibrosis medical care, which allowed me the opportunity to branch out on my own, seek out clients who need work done affordably and create a client base that is all my own.  Working remotely is indeed a gift. I've met wonderful people and truly enjoy the freedom of a family first schedule. I have clients from all over the United States that range from fitness chains to book publishers to real estate agents to automotive as well as being on-call for overflow from various design companies that I have a history with. The studio's name celebrates my devoted papillon Dakota. Since naming the studio – I have adopted three more papillons so maybe it should be Happy Dogs Studio by now!</p>
          <p>I have 28 years in the publishing industry, a deadline driven work ethic and extreme loyalty to my clients. From my start in Iowa newspapers back in the 1990's, to a Production Manager of over 140 monthly newsletters here in Naples and lastly a Traffic Manager, as well as Assistant to the Marketing Director, in a Marketing Department of a development company with five business areas from a mall to a design center. I enjoyed it all. I learned from the ground up how to assemble perfection no matter the tools I was given.</p> 
          <p>Throughout my planning and design work, I use my experience and organizational skills to keep elements for my client's marketing in step and by doing so, become a proactive force on their behalf. My first priority is to learn and refine a client’s style so that we are seeing the same vision, which creates successful design right out of the gate. I take on each client's likes/dislikes and style guidelines and become part of the machine that makes their marketing work. After all, my client’s successes are my successes as well as my ultimate goal.</p>
          <p><em>Why freelance? </em>For the love of family and the opportunity to let creativity soar at 10:00 in the morning or midnight - that's the difference between a creative outlet and a "job". That being said, my dogs like to push me to the studio as soon as they get up each morning - EVEN ON WEEKENDS! I'm wondering now who the boss really is!  It is truly great though, as creativity does not punch a clock and as they say, the best ideas might come out of nowhere, sometimes while making supper or reading a book or listeing to music! Creative thinking rarely fits in the strict timeframe of a "work day that's 9 to 5".  Freelance also allows me to keep marketing ideas fresh, as my mind isn't side-tracked into one type of media or one type of business.</p>
          <p><em>What am I'm looking for in a client?  </em>I am looking for long-term clients that need marketing created at an affordable price on a teammate level.  I am not your large "advertising firm" - I am a creative person that enjoys making beautiful pieces, professional pieces, and successful pieces. I enjoy the process of branding and setting clients apart from the rest. I've done the corporate marketing rat race and, while I learned many things, I truly enjoy the variety of working for several different clients from my studio.  I look past the job at hand to foresee consistent branding, usage, reuse, issues, paper quality, layout proportions for effectiveness, clarity, all to achieve the client's vision.</p>

          <p>I’ve been in publishing for over 28 years. I have practical experience in layout from pre-computer pasteup to complete computer layouts of multi-page documents with master pages and more! I have experience in producing files to match printer output needs. I pride myself in an application of a proven marketing workflow from concept to finished product. I also have an Associates in Accounting degree and dabble in some bookkeeping, but simply love design! <em>Coming soon: </em>Website Design Services -- I never stop learning!</p>

          <p>Marketing is an investment and should be a well constructed part of your business. I, in essence, become a “backstage advocate” thru marketing. Your company’s success goes hand-in-hand with my success. I strategize with clients to create marketing pieces and campaigns that are effective and creatively invest in my client's future by continuing to provide ideas for future marketing plans.</p>

          <p>My services are an extension of your company, but without the typical employee costs. I am strictly a contractor that does the same work as an in-house artist, but without the computer costs, software costs, office space, training costs, supply costs, the schedules, the non-productive times, insurance costs, parking spots, lunch breaks, supervision, etc. I will however, provide the dog treats for my end of the bargain or I'm in trouble!</p>
